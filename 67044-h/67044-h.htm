<h2 class="nobreak">MACK.</h2>
</div>


<p>The story of Mack begins in a Rescue
League in Albany, New York,
where he was born. The story was
very interesting to me as the lady
who owned Mack told me about him.
I will try to tell you about the unusual
circumstances in this kitten&#8217;s
life.</p>

<p>Mack was a Tiger Persian kitten
but was afflicted with a disease called
mange when he was very small. His
mother had a very bad case of the
mange, but instead of being cruelly
treated, her mistress took her to the
Rescue League where she could be
well cared for. While under treatment
in this League, which was a
home for sick, afflicted and homeless
kittens, Mack was born. A short time
after his birth he and his brothers
and sisters became afflicted with the
disease of the mother. When Mack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
was six weeks old the mother and
all the kittens, excepting Mack, were
chloroformed, because of their awful
condition with the disease.</p>

<p>Mack was left an orphan kitten with
no home but the quarters of the Rescue
League. One day a kind lady
went to this League and from all the
kittens there she selected Mack to go
and live in her home. This was very
kind of the lady because Mack needed
a home. Let us not forget this example
when we see a homeless or
hungry kitten. It would be easy
for many people to make kittens happy
in this way.</p>

<p>The lady who took Mack had a little
daughter who became attached to the
kitten and in a few weeks they were
the best of friends. By the time Mack
was one year old he had learned many
tricks and was very obedient. When
he wanted someone to open the door
he would stand on his hind feet and
put both front feet around the door
knob and try to open the door or
attract attention. It was a good thing
that Mack learned to do this. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
night he was left in the kitchen to
sleep. The little girl of the home,
Mack&#8217;s little mistress, was asleep in
another room which opened into the
kitchen. About two o&#8217;clock that night
the girl&#8217;s mother heard Mack rattling
the door knob and meowing with all
his might. She knew that something
was wrong so she went to the kitchen
to see why he was calling so much.
When she opened the door she saw
that the kitchen was on fire and the
blaze had almost reached the door of
the little girl&#8217;s room, where Mack
was calling for help. His fur was
scorched a little but he was not seriously
burned. The mother said that
five minutes more and the blaze would
have been beyond control and would
have made its way into the little girl&#8217;s
bedroom. She feels that Mack saved
her daughter&#8217;s life by calling for her
to open the door.</p>

<p>When the lady and her daughter
moved from Albany, New York, to
Chicago, they did not leave Mack behind.
He moved with them as one
of the family and lived for a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
time in a boarding house in the big
city. There are so many kittens that
do not get to travel over the country;
neither do they get to live in boarding
houses. Almost any kitten is satisfied
to have a good place to sleep and
plenty to eat. There is another thing
most kittens like, and that is kind
treatment. They like to be petted and
loved as well as being cared for with
home and food.</p>

<p>After leaving Chicago, Mack moved
to Kansas City with his kind mistress.
For some time he lived in this city but
at last he moved to Maple Park, just
east of the city on the Interurban line
to Excelsior Springs. It was there he
lived and spent many happy days.
Out there in the open, away from the
crowded streets of the big cities, Mack
caught grasshoppers as his favorite
pastime in the fields. This he enjoyed
very much and it was also good exercise
for him.</p>

<p>When the lady&#8217;s husband would sit
down to read the evening paper in
the big Morris chair, Mack would always
sleep on one of the arms of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
chair. At meal time he would sit in
a high chair at the table and eat just
what was given to him. He would
not offer to get on the table nor bother
anything in the kitchen. One day
another kitten came into the home to
live but he was not so careful to keep
out of the food not intended for him.
When he would try to get into anything
or stand up against the cabinet
or table, Mack would box his ears and
make him get away. Mack had been
trained from his baby days to keep off
the table or cabinet and to keep out
of food which did not belong to him.</p>

<p>The years passed by in Mack&#8217;s life
until he became a very old cat. He
never forgot his early training and the
many little tricks which he had been
taught to do. Of course, his mistress
thought more of him after he saved
the little girl from the fire but he always
had a favorite place in everything.</p>

<p>At the ripe old age of fourteen
years Mack died. His life had been
useful and he had been kind and obedient
through all the years. It was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
sad day in the home when Mack died.
The whole family went to his burial.
He was buried at Maple Park in a
little grave over which many tears
were shed. He was loved by all and
had helped to make life brighter with
the life which he had lived. A beautiful
and obedient cat was laid to rest.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SNOOKS.</h2>
</div>


<p>Snooks was a very small kitten and
lived in a preacher&#8217;s home. He was
well liked by the children in the home.
One day one of the girls became very
ill and for weeks everyone had to be
very quiet. The kitten liked to be in
the house and romp with the children
but during those weeks of sickness
he had to stay outdoors. One day a
young man called at the house on an
errand and as he turned to leave he
noticed the kitten asleep in a chair on
the front porch. He told one of the
children that he would like to have
the little ball of gray and blue and to
his surprise the little girl gave it to
him.</p>

<p>The first ride the kitten ever had in
an automobile was that afternoon
when the young man started home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
with the little gift. Kittens do not
like to ride as dogs do, so this kitten
was afraid and had to be kept from
jumping out while the car was running.</p>

<p>The kitten soon made friends in the
new home and was named Snooks.
This name was given him by his new
mistress because a little pet chicken
she once had was named Snooks. He
was trained in many ways during the
early months in this new home and
could be trusted alone in the house for
he would not climb upon the table or
bother anything.</p>

<p>Nearly all kittens are afraid of water
but Snooks likes to get into it and
play by splashing it with his feet.
He also likes to take a bath for he
will not offer to scratch or bite, but
stands in the bathtub while his mistress
washes him.</p>

<p>Sometime during each day Snooks
has a big romp from room to room.
He has learned to run fast and then
jump on little rugs and slide on the
floor. Many times a day these rugs
have to be straightened and put back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
into place. On cold nights he is allowed
to sleep in the house on a little
bed which is all his own. This he
greatly enjoys, but little does he realize
that many poor kittens which have
no homes have to sleep out in the cold.
Many times they go to bed on the cold
ground and their little ears freeze
because they cannot keep warm.</p>

<p>One of the greatest delights of this
kitten is to play with a little rubber
ball which was bought for him. He
will chase it from room to room, like
playing with a mouse. He makes it
roll by striking it with his feet or
jumping at it. One day the ball rolled
under the pantry door and the mistress
heard Snooks meowing but did
not go to see what he wanted. Soon
he came to the living room and meowed
again and then started back toward
the kitchen still meowing. The
mistress followed and Snooks led her
to the door of the pantry and looked
under as much as to say, &#8220;I have lost
the little ball, will you get it for me?&#8221;
She opened the door and found the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
ball and the kitten went on playing
again perfectly satisfied.</p>

<p>On another day a Victrola was
brought into the house where Snooks
lives and at first he was afraid of
the music but soon showed signs of
interest. He would sit and listen and
liked to watch the records go &#8217;round
and &#8217;round. He would walk all around
the machine smelling and looking as
though trying to find where the music
and voices were coming from.</p>

<p>At this writing Snooks, the little
blue and gray kitten, is alive and well.
He lives in a college town but has
never gone to college. He is satisfied
to eat three times a day and every day
he plays with the little ball which he
enjoys so much. He is now about
one year old and is going to be a large
cat when grown. Let us hope that he
will always have a good home and be
well and playful.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DUMP.</h2>
</div>


<p>This is a very peculiar name for
a kitten but kittens often have peculiar
names. Dump could not be
called a beautiful kitten but his good
nature and playfulness made him attractive
and likeable. His mother
must have thought him pretty for she
petted him so much by smoothing his
fur with her tongue. I have not yet
told you the color of this kitten and I
am sure you are wondering about it.
You might say he was very pretty.
His fur was a bluish gray and white
and his face was white almost all
over. He was just a common kitten
but you know the common kittens are
smart and many times as good in disposition
as the thorough-breds.</p>

<p>Dump was very playful and would
do many cute things. One thing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
he did and seemed to like most of all
was playing hide and seek in the house.
He would get behind the door and wait
for his little mistress to come and then
he would jump out at her as though
he meant to frighten her. Of course,
she had jumped at him in the same
way many times and in this way had
taught him the game of hide and
seek.</p>

<p>One afternoon in the summer time
the little girl thought of something
to do of which Dump had not thought.
It was this. The girl had a nice
little kodak which her uncle had given
her and she thought of taking Dump&#8217;s
picture. Not very many kittens are
fortunate enough to have their pictures
taken. The little kitten had
never posed for a picture and of course
thought it was great fun, that is, if
he thought of it at all. Anyway, they
both went into the yard and the little
girl placed Dump on the gate post.
He seemed to know the purpose of
being placed there for he sat still in
the warm sun just like he was really
posing for the picture. It was a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
picture, too, and the girl has the little
picture yet, although she is grown now
and has a home of her own and another
kitten takes Dump&#8217;s place.</p>

<p>Dump always slept in the window
during the summer between the screen
and curtains. He would always answer
his little mistress with a little
meow when she called him. He knew
when it was time for his meals as his
master worked down town in a meat
shop and when he would go to the
house for his meals Dump would meet
him at the door and beg for meat.</p>

<p>When the yard was mowed and the
grass piled up in one big pile, the
kitten would run to it and hide himself
from his little mistress. This
was great fun for both. They loved
each other very much and where one
went around the yard or in the house
the other was to be found, too.</p>

<p>Dump never cared to play with other
kittens and would not be very friendly.
One of the neighbors had a big
cat next door, but Dump would never
let him come through the yard fence
if he saw him. He must have been a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
little selfish but probably it was because
he loved his mistress more than
other kittens.</p>

<p>Many times Dump would go to the
woodshed and watch for mice. He
nearly always caught one and he loved
to play with it for hours at a time
before eating it. One hot summer day
he played too long and it cost him
his life for he became overheated and
died in just a little while. The little girl
did everything she could for him but
could not save his life. Dump&#8217;s little
body was buried back of the cave beside
the graves of two little bantam
chickens and a little gold fish.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MITCH.</h2>
</div>


<p>Mitch was a beautiful Persian kitten
and lived in Kansas City, Missouri.
City kittens do not have such large
playgrounds as kittens on the farm
for many times they are kept in the
house almost all the time. There are
many dangers for kittens outside in
the big cities, too. Some one may
steal them and take them away from
their homes or they may get run over
by the cars and big trucks.</p>

<p>A little girl whose name was Mitchell
gave the kitten to the lady who told
me this story. The family called him
Mitchie for awhile after the name
Mitchell. Some of them thought that
name too long so they shortened it to
Mitch, and that became the name of
this beautiful Persian kitten.</p>

<p>The mistress kept a large fruit basket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
on the dining table and when there
was no fruit in it, Mitch used it for
a bed. He learned to run toward the
table and with one jump he would
land right in the basket. Then he
would curl up for a long nap and be
perfectly satisfied for hours. He always
liked to get into boxes and when
the dresser drawers were left open
he would get into them. It did not
make much difference to Mitch just
what it was for he could feel contented
in anything. One day a member of
the family brought something home
in a paper sack and taking the articles
out, laid the sack on the bed. In a
few minutes Mitch was curled up in
the sack, fast asleep.</p>

<p>The lady&#8217;s husband worked at night,
or about half the night, and when he
came home about midnight, Mitch
would always meet him at the head
of the stairs ready for a romp. He
loved to play with the man&#8217;s watch
chain but one day it was a costly play.
The watch was left on the dresser
with the chain hanging over the edge
and Mitch decided to romp with it a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
little while. Of course, he did not
know the watch might fall and break.
In some way he got his claws fastened
in the chain and jerked the watch to
the floor. Mitch did not mean to
break the watch but it cost about seven
dollars to have it repaired. Mitch
could not repair the broken watch
and he had no way of paying the
debt except by love and affection for
his master.</p>

<p>Mitch was like Snooks (in the other
story), he liked water and liked to
play in it. He was very careful about
keeping clean and would go to the
lavatory and put his feet in the water
and then wash his face. One faucet in
the bathtub leaked a little and Mitch
found that he could get a drink there.
In some way he learned that he could
strike the faucet with his feet and
turn on more water. One day some
member of the family had prepared
a half tub of water for a bath and
about the same time Mitch decided
that he wanted a drink. He went to
the bath room and as usual jumped
right over into the tub, but this time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
he landed in all the water. You should
have seen him scramble to get out for
he was terribly frightened.</p>

<p>One day the lady and her husband
moved away from the city to the farm
and of course Mitch went along and
became a country kitten. I am sure
that he liked to be on the farm where
he could get out into the big outdoors
and catch lots of mice. About
a year passed and the family moved
back to the city, but Mitch was left
on the farm with the family who
moved on the place. Evidently he did
not like his new friends or else decided
to go back to the city for he disappeared
one afternoon and has not been
heard of since. If you should see
Mitch anywhere it would be kind of
you to tell him that the fruit basket
is on the table in the city waiting for
him. His mistress, too, will be very
glad to hear from him or have him
return to his former home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THOMAS.</h2>
</div>


<p>Thomas is another very peculiar
name for a kitten. He was a grocery-man
by trade, as he lived in a grocery
store for seventeen years.</p>

<p>Like so many kittens, Thomas was
a stray that came to the store in
search of food. The proprietors of
the store, two brothers, were kind to
hungry and friendless kittens. They
allowed this kitten to live in the store,
and not many days after he arrived
they named him Thomas. At night he
slept in the basement of the store. He
kept the store free from mice, as he
was a good mouser. He was well
cared for, too, as he had plenty to
eat of everything that he liked which
the store furnished.</p>

<p>Because of kind treatment and
plenty to eat the kitten grew very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
rapidly and made a large cat when
fully grown. Many months before his
death he weighed thirteen or fourteen
pounds and was always fat and sleek.
So many poor, wretched cats that have
no home could be more like Thomas
if people would give them a home and
treat them kindly. A kind deed,
though done for a kitten, is not thrown
away.</p>

<p>Thomas had a favorite place to sit,
which was on one of the counters near
the front window of the store. In
this way he made many friends. He
was of a lovable disposition and kind
to everyone. He could have numbered
these friends by the score as all
the customers had a kind word or pat
for him. Many people would stop at
the window and look at him because
he was so large and beautiful. His fur
was gray and striped and he made a
very pretty ornament as well as a
good advertisement for the store.</p>

<p>The play ground for Thomas was in
the basement of the store building. He
had many a romp there but one romp
cost him his beautiful gray coat. Near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the basement stairs there was a large
oil can or tank that had a large top
which could be removed when the tank
was filled with oil. One of the employees
had left this top off and
Thomas stepped into the hole while
walking across the tank. The tank of
coal-oil did not make a very good
swimming pool nor bath tub. It was
lucky for Thomas that he got out alive.
The oil caused all the fur to come off
his body and this left him without a
coat. The only fur left was a little at
the end of his tail. Some one said
that his smooth body looked like that
of an elephant. Thomas was ashamed
of this condition and would not appear
in the main room of the store.
His meals had to be taken to the basement
for him and even then he would
not come into the light any more than
necessary. For three or four weeks
he remained in the dark corners of
the basement until a new coat of fur
was well started. The new coat was
even brighter and prettier than the
old one so Thomas did not lose so much
after all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>One of the brothers of the store
seemed to be more attached to Thomas
than the other. The cat noticed this
and showed his appreciation in many
ways. When this brother would go to
his meals Thomas would get on the
front counter and watch and wait for
him to return. He could see up the
street for a whole block the way his
kind master would return and he
would watch him all the way.</p>

<p>For seventeen years Thomas lived in
the grocery store after being taken in
as a homeless kitten. The men who
owned the store never regretted that
they had shown kindness to a dumb
animal and furnished a home for a cat
that had many times repaid them for
all the care and expense he had been
to them. Many new friends and acquaintances
had been made because of
Thomas on the front counter. New
customers had been added to the already
long list. The store contained
no mice to disturb anything and everyone
seemed happy because Thomas was
always happy. During all those years
he never spent more than two nights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
outside the store building. He always
attended to his own business and was
satisfied to stay at home and romp in
the basement play ground. At last he
died of old age and for many weeks
afterward people would look on the
counter for the old friend of former
days. There were many regrets expressed
when the news went out that
Thomas was dead. A life of good
fellowship and love had not been lived
in vain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TIGER.</h2>
</div>


<p>Perhaps you have read or heard of
tramp kittens. Sometimes they are
called little beggars. No doubt you
have seen such kittens along the roads
or on the streets. Sometimes they
will go for miles in search of food and
home. In cities and towns they will go
from house to house or to the stores
in search of scraps of food to eat.
Many times these kittens are afraid of
boys and girls because they have been
abused and often driven away with
rocks and clubs but they would like
to be treated kindly.</p>

<p>Tiger was one of these tramp kittens
in his young days. He had been cast
out from his home as an undesirable
kitten. Days and nights he wandered
around in the town in which he had
been left but no one seemed to care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
for a homeless kitten. Sometimes he
was able to find enough to eat but
many nights he slept in an alley,
cold and hungry.</p>

<p>One morning this tramp kitten was
sitting on the back porch of a drug
store very hungry. His little body
was wasting away. While sitting in
the warm sunshine on the porch he
went to sleep but was soon awakened
by someone opening the back door.
Instead of being kicked off the porch
with a warning not to return he was
surprised to hear kind words and to
feel a warm hand stroking his dirty
fur.</p>

<p>The kind words and tender strokes
came from a young boy whose name
was Frank and whose father owned
the store. In a few minutes Frank had
a little bed arranged by the stove in
the store and the tramp kitten was
soon fast asleep. A little later he
was awakened by Frank who had
brought scraps of meat from the meat
shop and this the hungry kitten enjoyed
very much.</p>

<p>When Frank&#8217;s father came in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
morning he was led back to the stove
where the kitten was sleeping and
asked if it might live in the store. The
father consented and by noon the little
boy and the little beggar kitten had
made friends for life.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to name him Tiger,&#8221;
said Frank that evening as he was
telling his mother of the new found
friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why name him Tiger, Frank?&#8221;
asked his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he looks like a Tiger,&#8221; answered
Frank. &#8220;His body has stripes
all over it just like the pictures of
Tigers in my books.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the months rolled by Tiger became
more and more at home in the
store. His little master fed him every
day and soon he was fat and sleek.
He grew very fast and became the pet
of the store force. He was taught
many tricks and it seemed that he
always tried to do what he was told.</p>

<p>By Frank&#8217;s continual training Tiger
became a little circus performer.
Frank would clasp both hands and
then hold out his arms in front of him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
forming a circle through which Tiger
would jump back and forth.</p>

<p>Another thing which attracted much
attention from the employees and customers
was that Tiger would try to
get into any kind of box left open or
set out for him. He never forgot this
and after becoming a full grown cat
he would try to get into little boxes.
Sometimes Frank or one of the clerks
would give him a small paste board
box and tell him to lie down in it. He
would turn &#8217;round and &#8217;round in it
until the sides were mashed and then
he would lie down on the flat piece
of the box. Sometimes they would
give him a very small pill box and he
would try to get into it. He would
walk all around it and at last would
lie down on top of it.</p>

<p>As the years went by Tiger became
the pet of all who knew him. His
master grew to be a young man but
the close friendship with the kitten
always existed. Tiger never failed to
receive good meals and kind treatment.</p>

<p>One evening while Tiger was lying
in the alley one of the clerks called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
him but he would not answer. The
man almost had to whip him to get
him back into the store. This was
very unusual. The clerk noticed the
changed attitude and spoke to others
about it.</p>

<p>During the night the fire alarm was
given and news soon spread that the
drug store was burning. Frank
thought first of Tiger and of his desire
to remain outside the store that
evening. The firemen arrived too late
to enter the building although it was
not entirely destroyed. The next day
Tiger was found on top of the office
desk near a rear window. He had
suffocated in the smoke but the flames
had not touched his body. Such was
the end of life for the obedient and
faithful Tiger.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SAMMY.</h2>
</div>


<p>It is very interesting to know why
pets are called the same names as
people. Not only cats and dogs, but
birds, horses, cows and other pets are
given the names of people. Many
times these names are given because
of fondness for the pets and love for
those after whom they are named.</p>

<p>The lady who told me this story
of Sammy also told me why she called
him this name. She had met a very
attractive young man while visiting
in another town and when she came
home she did not forget the new acquaintance.
In a few days after she
returned from the visit someone gave
her a little kitten which she named
Sammy for him. She never learned
whether the young man felt honored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
because of this, but the kitten was
well cared for.</p>

<p>Sammy was a beautiful Maltese kitten
but his young mistress did not
know where he was born nor anything
about his mother, sisters nor
brothers. He seemed like an orphan
kitten and was given the best of care.
In a little while he was satisfied in
the new home and seemed to be perfectly
happy.</p>

<p>As the months rolled by, Sammy
and his mistress became very fond of
each other. One day something happened
which changed the course of
events. The young lady made another
acquaintance&mdash;this time of a young
man who had gone into business in
her home town. Sammy was afraid
of all strangers and would not play
with any of the boys in the neighborhood
and would not make friends with
any of the young men who called on
his mistress. When the nice looking
business man began visiting the young
lady Sammy also became acquainted
with him. From the first visit he
seemed to like the new acquaintance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
and soon they were close friends.
When the young man called at the
home Sammy would always meet him
at the gate and accompany him to
the door. When his mistress would
allow him to do so he would go into
the house so that the young man
might pet him.</p>

<p>Sammy was never trained to catch
mice and was never given one to eat.
It is often a good thing to have a cat
that will catch mice, but sometimes
it proves very fatal as mice are often
poisoned and thrown out or die where
the kittens can find them. Sammy was
not allowed to eat meat either, especially
raw meat. Feeding raw meat has
proven very costly to many valuable
cats as it has made them of vicious
or cross disposition. The mistress of
Sammy was very careful to cultivate
in him a kind and obedient disposition.</p>

<p>In the yard of the home there was
an old tree in which Sammy spent
many happy hours in the warm sunshine.
Not many feet from the ground
the tree forked and this made a very
desirable place to get out of the reach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
of dogs and to rest or sleep. This
had been a favorite resting place for
Trilby, a kitten that lived in the home
long before Sammy was born. The
lady said that both kittens had used
the old tree for a resting place and
that she had often regretted that she
had not taken their pictures. I am
sorry, too, as I would like to have
shown you the picture of Sammy in
this book, but we will have to imagine
how peaceful he was as he slept in
the warm sunshine.</p>

<p>One beautiful autumn day in September,
the young man whom Sammy
loved and who had been going to the
home very often, went to take Sammy&#8217;s
mistress away. Sammy was
pleased to have the young man there
although he did not understand why
so many people were there and what
it all meant.</p>

<p>A few days after the couple were
married they moved to a little cottage
in another part of town and took Sammy
along to live with them. In this
new home he seemed perfectly satisfied
and never tried to go back to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
old home again. He spent many happy
days in this home and every evening
he would go down the street to meet
his new master. The young couple
became very much attached to Sammy
and gave him the best place in almost
everything. Have you ever heard of
a spoiled kitten? Sammy was like
some children who are allowed to have
their way for he became a spoiled kitten
later in life.</p>

<p>On another day, many months after
the beautiful autumn wedding day, a
little baby came into the home to live.
Sammy did not know what to think of
a baby crying and to see everyone
making over the new daughter. In
those days he felt somewhat neglected
as he was not petted as much as usual
but he soon became attached to the
little one in the crib. He seemed to
love the baby as much as anyone else
and at last he became so jealous that
he would try to protect her when anyone
would lift her from the crib. He
would almost fight the young father
or mother to keep them away as he
seemed to think that they should not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
fondle her. He must have been afraid
that they would hurt his little playmate,
although the baby never got to
play with Sammy except to coo at him
from the crib. He became so cross
and so jealous that he had to be given
away.</p>

<p>The father saw a man in town one
day who lived in the country and he
told this man about Sammy and of
how good he had been until he became
jealous of the baby. Sammy was given
to this man and he went to live on a
farm. I have wondered how much he
missed the baby but probably the farm
life attracted his attention so much
that he did not grieve very long over
the change. He lived to be seven or
eight years old and proved to be a
valuable cat on the farm. He never
got to see his little baby mistress again
but after she grew older she was told
of Sammy&#8217;s fondness for her. She
is now three or four years older than
Sammy was when he died but of course
she can remember nothing about him
except as the parents have told her.</p>

<p>Sammy is buried on a farm not far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
from Liberty, Missouri, and those who
knew and loved him will never forget
the story of his life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BETTY.</h2>
</div>


<p>Betty is of the Persian breed of cats
like Mitch and Mack in two other
stories of this book. She lives at
Winnwood Lake, just east of Kansas
City, and has a good home and a kind
mistress. She is of a loveable disposition.
Her father is the famous
White Czar, of Kansas City, and her
mother is of good stock.</p>

<p>Betty has not traveled over the
country like Mack in the other story
but she is satisfied to live in a comfortable
home with her mistress. She
has no time for traveling anyway,
because she has to be at home with
her family of kittens. I am not sure
she is perfectly satisfied though because
three of her kittens are far
from home today.</p>

<p>The day that Betty&#8217;s first babies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
were born was very gloomy and by
night a storm was gathering which
broke from the clouds in all of its
fury later in the night. The trees
were howling in the wind and the
thunder and lightning caused Betty
and her mistress much fear. The lady
had gone to bed that night before the
storm came on and Betty was in the
corner of the room with her new babies.
When the noise of the storm
was heard, Betty ran to the bed but in
a few seconds went back to the box
to be with the kittens. She kept this
up, going back and forth, for several
minutes. At last the lady told her
to bring the kittens to the bed. It
seemed that she knew what her mistress
had said for she went to the box
in the corner three times, each time
taking a kitten to the bed. After three
kittens had been placed on the bed,
Betty took a long breath and seemed
almost exhausted by jumping back
and forth so many times. The lady
told her that she had left one kitten
in the box so again she went to the
corner, this time getting the fourth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
kitten. After a second attempt she
jumped upon the bed and then cuddled
down to sleep regardless of the raging
storm. She had been used to sleeping
on the bed, but was not satisfied to
sleep there that night and leave the
four kittens in the box in the corner
of the room. This act of Betty&#8217;s
showed the mother love for her babies.</p>

<p>The four kittens grew to be beautiful
pets. There were three brothers
and one sister in Betty&#8217;s family. One
of the brothers was taken to the state
of Michigan, and one was sent to
Abilene, Kansas. The third brother,
named Jack, went to France with a
Captain and his wife during the war.
Only this one of the brothers went to
war. It seems that it would be right
for Betty to have a blue star for Jack.
The sister, Blue Bell, is still at home
with her mother. The father of Blue
Bell and the three brothers is Blue-Eyed
Billy, another famous cat of
Kansas City.</p>

<p>Blue Bell is not alone now because
Betty has two more babies in the
home. The father of these two younger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
kittens is called John and he seems
to love them as much as Betty does.
He will get into the box and wash
their faces just like the mother cat.
Betty does not forget Blue Bell as her
first baby. She is almost two years
old now, but Betty washes her face
and ears every day just like she did
when Blue Bell was a little kitten.</p>

<p>Betty is very fond of going down
to the lake and catching craw-fish
for the kittens. She will sit near the
water until a craw-fish comes in sight
near the edge and then with one grab
she has it. She always catches them
by the back so they cannot pinch
her with their sharp pinchers.</p>

<p>Another of her favorite pastimes
is gathering the eggs. Betty goes with
her mistress every morning and looks
into all the nests. If she finds eggs in
the nests she will wait until her mistress
takes them out. If she looks
into a nest and finds no eggs she goes
on to the next. In this way Betty
helps her mistress every evening.</p>

<p>Betty always knows when Saturday
comes because her mistress goes to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
town on that day. Betty expects a
treat of good meat on Saturday.
When the lady gets home from town
Betty always goes to the hand bag and
smells for meat. If she finds none
she will go back to her box and lie
down greatly disappointed. If she
smells the meat then she sits upon her
hind feet begging for it and is not satisfied
until she and the kittens have
the special Saturday treat.</p>

<p>When the lady goes to the mail box
for mail Betty always desires to go
along. She climbs the post and looks
into the box when her mistress opens
it but she has never learned to carry
the mail to the house.</p>

<p>Betty still lives at Winnwood Lake
and with the help of John she is carefully
rearing a family of three beautiful
and obedient kittens.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">JIMMIE.</h2>
</div>


<p>Jimmie was a drug store cat, following
the same occupation as Tiger
in the story called Tiger. One of the
clerks in the store found him in the
alley one morning while burning some
old boxes. The kitten was poor and
hungry and seemed to be homeless and
friendless. He was a stranger in the
neighborhood and no one ever came
to the store to claim him. He was
lost and lonesome when picked up and
seemed very glad to find a friend. He
was only a stray kitten and no one
knew of his mother nor where he was
born. This seems sad but with Jimmie
it gave him a distinguished place
later in life which I will tell you about
in this story.</p>

<p>In a little while Jimmie was growing
and happy in the new home. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
made friends with all of the clerks
in the store and especially with the
proprietor. They became devoted
friends for life; even money could not
separate them as a large sum was offered
for him but his master loved him
more than money.</p>

<p>Some of the clerks taught him to
jump through hoops or through their
arms or over their feet. On one of the
counters in the drug store there was
a large clock which became the resting
place for Jimmie. When told to
go and get on the clock he would obey
instantly and then look around at
those watching him as though he was
proud of the feat. One day his master
took a picture of him as he sat on
the clock and he seemed to pose for
it. The picture is now in the desk
of the drug store although Jimmie
has been dead three years. When I
asked Jimmie&#8217;s master for the facts
about this story he turned to the desk
and showed me the picture. While
we were speaking of the kitten&#8217;s life
a man came into the room who used
to know and love Jimmie. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
asked if he knew the picture and when
he looked at it he exclaimed, &#8220;that&#8217;s
Jimmie!&#8221; This shows how much he
was loved and that he was well known.
Like Thomas of the grocery store in
the other story Jimmie had scores of
friends and is remembered by many
citizens in the town in which he lived.</p>

<p>During one of the cat shows in Convention
Hall in Kansas City a few
years ago, Jimmie was also on exhibition.
He attracted much attention although
he was not a thorough-bred
and was only a stray. His fur was
striped like a tiger and in the show
he received first prize as the best tiger
cat shown. He also won first prize
as a stray, but to receive the premium
his master had to take three witnesses
before a notary public and make affidavit
that Jimmie was found in the
alley and that no one knew of his
birth or his pedigree. After receiving
these prizes Jimmie&#8217;s master thought
more of him than ever. He attracted
much attention in his home town, too,
when the news went out that Jimmie
had won first at tiger and stray. New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
friends went to the store to see him
and he, too, became a good advertisement
for the store.</p>

<p>One day a physician&#8217;s wife from another
town went into the drug store
and saw Jimmie sitting on the old
clock. She soon made his acquaintance
and became attached to him.
She was a lover of kittens and Jimmie
so large and beautiful seemed to her
an ideal kitten. She asked all about
him, of his birth, pedigree, disposition
and many other questions. When
told that he was only a stray picked
up in the alley as a homeless kitten
she seemed to think more of him than
ever. Perhaps she had been kind to
some homeless kitten sometime in the
past and understood what it meant
to care for one that needed a friend.
She was anxious to have him as her
own and let him live in her own home.
I am sure that she would have given
him the best of care and that he would
have had a good home in which to
spend his old age. In a few days the
woman&#8217;s husband was in the town and
went to the store and offered twenty-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
dollars for Jimmie. The proprietor
would not sell him for that, and
then the physician offered him fifty
dollars, but Jimmie&#8217;s master said that
money could not buy him. Such was
the love for a kitten that had been
so kind and obedient during the many
years in the store.</p>

<p>About two weeks after the physician
had offered the fifty dollars for him,
Jimmie in some way got hold of poison
and died. He was nine years old at
the time of his death and left many
friends who have greatly missed him
during these past three years.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PETE.</h2>
</div>


<p>To get the story of Pete I had to go
to a large hotel and there I found an
old gentleman who had lost his wife
by death about a year before and who
seemed lonely for her presence. He
told all that he could about Pete, but
said, &#8220;if she were only here,&#8221; pointing
to a picture on the wall, &#8220;she could
tell you a fine story of this kitten.
She loved cats as no one else on earth,
I suppose,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Such deeds
are not thrown away either, although
I used to think many of them were
unnecessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>One morning, while the good wife
was living, they lost their last kitten
and she had said that they would not
try to raise or care for any more.
That same morning Pete arrived at the
back door of the home and begged for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
something to eat. He was invited inside
and that was all that was necessary
to make friends between the lady
and the homeless kitten. Pete was
not so young either at that time for
he seemed to be nearly two years old.</p>

<p>The gentleman said that there never
was a cat that could fight like Pete.
He was not afraid of anything that
walked and could whip any dog that
ever came into the yard. When he made
up his mind that he did not want any
dog or certain cats around the house
or yard it was then that they had to
leave. He would sometimes make up
with a cat after giving him a good
flogging if the cat was willing to stay
long enough to make up. He was an
awful fighter and yet he was of a good
disposition around the home. Of all
the kittens this lady had and loved and
cared for there was none so loveable
and of a better character than Pete.
If it had not been for his fighting nature
he would have been an ideal cat
in every way. Perhaps the brave spirit
he showed helped him to protect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
himself from cruel dogs and mean
cats.</p>

<p>For ten years Pete occupied the best
chair in the home for his resting place
and bed. He had things his own way
because he was loved by all the members
of the family. His food consisted
of anything and everything that
money could buy. He lacked for nothing
that would make him contented
and happy.</p>

<p>When baby kittens were born in the
neighborhood Pete was always one of
the first visitors and took charge of
the kittens along with the mother cat.
He would fight for the baby kittens
and protect them with his own life.
No mother cat was afraid to leave her
kittens in charge of Pete because they
all knew his daring spirit and courageous
nature.</p>

<p>After the death of the kind mistress
Pete missed her very much. He missed
her loving caresses and the good meals
which she always provided for him.
Of course the other members of the
family took good care of him then, but
the mistress of the home had been the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
one he had largely depended upon.
She would get up any time in the night
and let him in if he came to the door
and called. If he was not in the house
at supper time a good meal would be
placed back for him and then during
the night if he came to the door she
would let him in and warm his supper
for him. All this he greatly missed
although he was well taken care of.</p>

<p>Today he lives in a Boarding School
for cats in the city of Chicago and is
visited once each week at least by a
daughter of his former mistress. This
daughter loves Pete too and Pete loves
her just as much. When she goes to
the boarding place to see him he will
come to her and put both front feet
around her neck and try in every way
to show his affection. He is now about
fourteen years old and weighs sixteen
and one half pounds. During March
of this year (1919) the old gentleman
received a letter from his daughter in
Chicago saying that Pete was well and
seemingly contented in the Boarding
School. It costs two or three dollars
a week to keep him there but this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
kindness is due him after such faithful
service during all the years.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
